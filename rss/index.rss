&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After graduating from undergrad, I spent the past 2.5 years working for a SaaS company that provides a business intelligence tool to highly complex industries. After 2.5 years of working in the same position, I decided to fully commit into studying web development by applying for Hack Reactor. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application process was quick, and I scheduled for my technical interview to occur the following week after I submitted my application.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study material HR gave to us to study for the technical interview was on point. Everything we needed to know conceptually was somewhere in the study material.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a bit of freaking out because I wasn't contacted for over a week, I finally received an offer to join the November 16, 2015 cohort a little over a week later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it all, I think I got pretty lucky with the entire process. Aside from my worrying that I wouldn't get in for the better part of a week, there were no hiccups in the process and the timing could not have been better. Hashtag blessed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>First blog post!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post... EVER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll put up my first quality post within the next few days going over my road to Hack Reactor. I'd do it right now, except I just already spent a hefty amount of time today messing with the layout and interface of the blog. Just getting the social media navigation button for Linkedin into production took about 2 hours. At least it helped me brush up on Handlebars.js!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
